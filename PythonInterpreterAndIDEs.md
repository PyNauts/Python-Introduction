The Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code. It can operate in two modes:
- **Interactive Mode**: Allows you to enter code and see results immediately, making it useful for quick testing and experimentation.
- **Script Mode**: Executes scripts saved in files, enabling you to run complete programs.
